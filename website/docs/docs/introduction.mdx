## PromptChart

PromptChart is a framework-agnostic system that converts natural language into data visualizations.

### Architecture

The data flow is simple, PromptChart [web component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-chart) sends a prompt to the [backend](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/PromptChart/tree/main/examples), which then sends it to an LLM to generate structured intent.
The backend then executes the query against your data source and returns chart-ready data that is rendered by the web component.

1. `prompt-chart` component sends a natural language prompt (e.g., "Show sales by region")
2. Backend sends the prompt to an LLM to generate structured intent
3. A data adapter executes the query against your data source
4. Chart-ready data is returned and rendered

### Open Source

PromptChart is built by the community, for the community. All contributions are welcome!
